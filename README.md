# LEADS

A specialized foundation model for study search, study screening, and data extraction from medical literature.

## Overview

LEADS is an AI foundation model specifically designed for medical literature mining tasks in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Developed to address the limitations of generic large language models in medical contexts, LEADS excels at three critical tasks:

1. **Study Search**: Formulating precise search strategies to identify relevant clinical trials
2. **Study Screening**: Evaluating publications against inclusion/exclusion criteria
3. **Data Extraction**: Extracting structured information from medical literature

The model is trained on LEADSInstruct, a comprehensive dataset of 633,759 instruction data points curated from:
- 21,335 systematic reviews
- 453,625 clinical trial publications
- 27,015 clinical trial registries

In rigorous evaluations, LEADS consistently outperformed four cutting-edge generic LLMs across six medical literature mining tasks. When integrated into expert workflows, LEADS demonstrated significant improvements in both quality and efficiency:

</p>

- **Study Selection**: Experts using LEADS achieved 0.81 recall (vs. 0.77 for experts working alone) with 22.6% time savings
- **Data Extraction**: Experts using LEADS achieved 0.85 accuracy (vs. 0.80 without LEADS) with 26.9% time savings


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU with at least 16GB VRAM
- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) for efficient model serving

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RyanWangZf/LEADS.git
   cd LEADS
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the LEADS model from Hugging Face:
   ```bash
   # Install git-lfs if you don't have it already
   apt-get install git-lfs  # For Ubuntu/Debian
   # or
   brew install git-lfs  # For macOS

   # Initialize git-lfs
   git lfs install

   # Clone the model repository
   git clone https://huggingface.co/zifeng-ai/leads-mistral-7b-v1 /path/to/models/leads-mistral-7b-v1
   
   # Alternatively, you can use the Hugging Face CLI
   pip install huggingface_hub
   huggingface-cli download zifeng-ai/leads-mistral-7b-v1 --local-dir /path/to/models/leads-mistral-7b-v1
   ```

## Configuring and Running LEADS

### 1. Configure vLLM

Create a configuration file `llm_server/vllm_config.yaml` with the following settings:

```yaml
dtype: auto
served_model_name: zifeng-ai/leads-mistral-7b-v1
port: 13141
api_key: testtoken
gpu_memory_utilization: 0.6
max_num_seqs: 256
tensor_parallel_size: 1
```

Then create a `.env` file in the root directory to set the endpoint and API key:

```.env
LEADS_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:13141/v1
LEADS_API_KEY=testtoken
MODEL_PATH=zifeng-ai/leads-mistral-7b-v1
CUDA_DEVICE=0
```

### 2. Start the LEADS Server

Use the provided script in `llm_server/vllm_serve.sh`:

Make it executable and run:
```bash
chmod +x llm_server/vllm_serve.sh
./llm_server/vllm_serve.sh
```

### 3. Test the LEADS Server

You can test if the server is running correctly with a simple query:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("LEADS_API_KEY"),
    base_url=os.getenv("LEADS_ENDPOINT"),
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="zifeng-ai/leads-mistral-7b-v1",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the PICO framework in evidence-based medicine?"}
    ],
    temperature=0.0,
    max_tokens=1024,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Use Cases

LEADS specializes in three main tasks for systematic reviews:

### 1. Literature Search

LEADS can help formulate effective search strategies for medical literature:

```python
from leads.api import search_query_generation

pico = {
    "population": "Adults with type 2 diabetes",
    "intervention": "SGLT2 inhibitors",
    "comparison": "GLP-1 receptor agonists",
    "outcome": "Cardiovascular outcomes and glycemic control"
}

search_query = search_query_generation(**pico)
print(search_query)
```

Example output:
```json
['((pulmonary atelectasis) OR (type 2 diabetes AND incretin deficiency) OR (type 2 diabetes AND established cardiovascular disease) OR (type 2 diabetes) OR (type 2 diabetes AND patients uncontrolled on metformin)) AND ((sonographic technique) OR (5-HTQ) OR (empagliflozin) OR (pharmacogenomics) OR (linagliptin))', '((pulmonary atelectasis) OR (type 2 diabetes AND incretin deficiency) OR (type 2 diabetes AND established cardiovascular disease) OR (type 2 diabetes) OR (type 2 diabetes AND patients uncontrolled on metformin)) AND ((saxagliptin) OR (Empagliflozin AND Fixed-Dose) OR (teglazidine) OR (teglazidine AND sulphonylurea) OR (empagliflozin AND SGLT2 inhibitor))', '((pulmonary atelectasis) OR (type 2 diabetes AND incretin deficiency) OR (type 2 diabetes AND established cardiovascular disease) OR (type 2 diabetes) OR (type 2 diabetes AND patients uncontrolled on metformin)) AND ((dapagliflozin))', '((type 2 diabetes AND treatment-naive participants) OR (type 2 diabetes AND Japanese patients AND urine glucose) OR (type 2 diabetes AND older patients) OR (type 2 diabetes AND naive patients) OR (Typical schistosomiasis AND Buruli ulcer AND African hydatid)) AND ((sonographic technique) OR (5-HTQ) OR (empagliflozin) OR (pharmacogenomics) OR (linagliptin))', '((type 2 diabetes AND treatment-naive participants) OR (type 2 diabetes AND Japanese patients AND urine glucose) OR (type 2 diabetes AND older patients) OR (type 2 diabetes AND naive patients) OR (Typical schistosomiasis AND Buruli ulcer AND African hydatid)) AND ((saxagliptin) OR (Empagliflozin AND Fixed-Dose) OR (teglazidine) OR (teglazidine AND sulphonylurea) OR (empagliflozin AND SGLT2 inhibitor))', '((type 2 diabetes AND treatment-naive participants) OR (type 2 diabetes AND Japanese patients AND urine glucose) OR (type 2 diabetes AND older patients) OR (type 2 diabetes AND naive patients) OR (Typical schistosomiasis AND Buruli ulcer AND African hydatid)) AND ((dapagliflozin))', '((type 2 diabetes AND insufficiently controlled) OR (type 2 diabetes AND metformin-treated patients AND metformin-intolerant patients) OR (type 2 diabetes AND established cardiovascular disease) OR (type 2 diabetes AND inadequate glycemic control AND obese patients) OR (type 2 diabetes AND intolerant to metformin)) AND ((sonographic technique) OR (5-HTQ) OR (empagliflozin) OR (pharmacogenomics) OR (linagliptin))', '((type 2 diabetes AND insufficiently controlled) OR (type 2 diabetes AND metformin-treated patients AND metformin-intolerant patients) OR (type 2 diabetes AND established cardiovascular disease) OR (type 2 diabetes AND inadequate glycemic control AND obese patients) OR (type 2 diabetes AND intolerant to metformin)) AND ((saxagliptin) OR (Empagliflozin AND Fixed-Dose) OR (teglazidine) OR (teglazidine AND sulphonylurea) OR (empagliflozin AND SGLT2 inhibitor))', '((type 2 diabetes AND insufficiently controlled) OR (type 2 diabetes AND metformin-treated patients AND metformin-intolerant patients) OR (type 2 diabetes AND established cardiovascular disease) OR (type 2 diabetes AND inadequate glycemic control AND obese patients) OR (type 2 diabetes AND intolerant to metformin)) AND ((dapagliflozin))', '((type 2 diabetes AND established cardiovascular disease)) AND ((sonographic technique) OR (5-HTQ) OR (empagliflozin) OR (pharmacogenomics) OR (linagliptin))', '((type 2 diabetes AND established cardiovascular disease)) AND ((saxagliptin) OR (Empagliflozin AND Fixed-Dose) OR (teglazidine) OR (teglazidine AND sulphonylurea) OR (empagliflozin AND SGLT2 inhibitor))', '((type 2 diabetes AND established cardiovascular disease)) AND ((dapagliflozin))']
```

### 2. Study Screening

LEADS can screen studies based on PICO criteria:

```python
from leads.api import screening_study

pico = {
    "population": "Adult patients (â‰¥18 years) with type 2 diabetes",
    "intervention": "SGLT2 inhibitors",
    "comparison": "Placebo or any active comparator",
    "outcome": "Cardiovascular outcomes including blood pressure changes"
}

abstract = """
[Title] Efficacy and Safety of Canagliflozin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Trial
[Abstract] Background: SGLT2 inhibitors represent a novel class of glucose-lowering agents. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods: In this 52-week, randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 258 patients with type 2 diabetes to receive canagliflozin (100mg or 300mg) or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints included changes in fasting plasma glucose, body weight, and blood pressure.
Results: Mean age was 56 years. Canagliflozin significantly reduced HbA1c compared to placebo (-0.77% and -1.03% for 100mg and 300mg, respectively; p<0.001). Significant reductions in body weight and systolic blood pressure were also observed. Adverse events included genital mycotic infections and increased urination.
Conclusion: Canagliflozin improved glycemic control, reduced body weight, and lowered blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes.
"""

result = screening_study(abstract, **pico)
print(result)
```

Example output:
```json
{
  "evaluations": [
    {"criterion": "Population", "eligibility": "YES", "rationale": "The study includes adult patients with type 2 diabetes with a mean age of 56 years."},
    {"criterion": "Intervention", "eligibility": "YES", "rationale": "The intervention includes canagliflozin, which is an SGLT2 inhibitor."},
    {"criterion": "Comparison", "eligibility": "YES", "rationale": "The study uses placebo as a comparator."},
    {"criterion": "Outcome", "eligibility": "YES", "rationale": "The study reports blood pressure as a secondary outcome, which is a cardiovascular parameter."},
  ]
}
```

### 3. Data Extraction

LEADS can extract structured data from medical studies:

```python
from leads.api import extract_study_characteristics

full_text = """

"""

characteristics = extract_study_characteristics(full_text, 
fields_info = [
    "n: number of subjects involved in the study for analysis",
    "condition: the target conditions",
    "intervention: the target interventions"
])
print(characteristics)
```

Example output:
```json
{
  "fields": [
    {"name": "n", "value": 258},
    {"name": "condition", "value": "Type 2 diabetes"},
    {"name": "intervention", "value": "Canagliflozin (100mg or 300mg)"}
  ]
}
```

## Model Limitations

While LEADS demonstrates strong performance on medical literature mining tasks, users should be aware of the following limitations:

- LEADS is specialized for medical literature and may not perform optimally on general domain tasks
- The model's knowledge is limited to its training data and may not reflect the most recent medical research
- As with all AI systems, outputs should be reviewed by qualified medical professionals before making clinical decisions
